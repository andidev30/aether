## Aether Frontend

The frontend is a standalone Vite + React application that provides an audit console for testing the backend service.

### Getting Started

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` and automatically reloads on file changes.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the Vite development server.
- `npm run build` — type-check and create a production build.
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally.
