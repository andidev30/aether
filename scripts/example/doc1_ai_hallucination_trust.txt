AI Hallucination and Trust in Generative Models

Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude have transformed the way people interact with information. They can summarize complex documents, generate creative content, and even simulate human conversation. However, these models have a critical weakness — hallucination. In the context of AI, hallucination means producing statements that sound confident but are factually incorrect or entirely fabricated. 

In 2023, a lawyer in New York submitted a legal brief generated by ChatGPT that included six fake court cases. The model had fabricated case names, judges, and citations that did not exist. The lawyer assumed the AI’s confident tone meant the sources were real. This event became a defining example of how over-trusting AI can lead to serious professional and ethical consequences. Similar incidents have occurred across journalism, education, and healthcare, where generated answers were confidently wrong.

The technical cause of hallucination lies in how LLMs are trained. These models predict the next word based on statistical probability from vast text corpora, but they do not inherently know truth. They are excellent at language, not knowledge verification. Therefore, they sometimes “fill in gaps” with plausible but incorrect statements — an emergent side effect of over-generalization.

To combat this, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks were introduced. RAG integrates search engines or databases, such as Elastic Cloud or Google Discovery Engine, to fetch relevant facts before an LLM generates an answer. This approach grounds the model’s responses in real evidence. When combined with embeddings (like Google Vertex AI’s 768-dimension semantic vectors), the model can match queries to verified documents, reducing hallucination rates dramatically.

In Indonesia, penggunaan chatbot AI di sektor layanan publik mulai meningkat, seperti pada sistem helpdesk pemerintah dan perusahaan telekomunikasi. Namun, beberapa sistem internal menunjukkan masalah serupa — AI menjawab dengan informasi yang salah atau tidak relevan karena tidak terhubung ke basis data yang mutakhir. Misalnya, chatbot layanan pelanggan salah menjelaskan kebijakan refund karena datanya belum disinkronkan. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa hallucination bukan hanya masalah teknis, tapi juga masalah tata kelola data (data governance).

Trust becomes the central theme here. People tend to anthropomorphize AI — giving it credibility as if it “knows” — padahal sebenarnya model hanya memprediksi teks. Transparency and explainability must accompany accuracy. Systems like Aether aim to audit every AI response: checking for bias, hallucination, and source confidence. This level of introspection is essential for restoring user trust.

When AI is transparent about uncertainty (for instance, showing a “confidence score” or referencing source documents), users are less likely to be misled. In future deployments, AI systems might include an “audit trail” showing which sources were used for each answer — a practice similar to citing references in academic papers.

Ultimately, hallucination is not a bug but a symptom of a deeper truth: AI is a mirror of human knowledge — full of brilliance and error alike. What matters is not eliminating mistakes entirely, but ensuring accountability, grounding, and human oversight remain in the loop.
