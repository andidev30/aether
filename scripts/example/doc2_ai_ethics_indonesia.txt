Ethical and Regulatory Challenges of AI in Indonesia

Artificial Intelligence promises to revolutionize industries, from finance and healthcare to education and agriculture. But as its adoption accelerates, questions of ethics, fairness, and accountability have become increasingly urgent — especially in emerging economies like Indonesia. The ethical landscape of AI is shaped not just by technology, but by local values, legal systems, and socio-economic realities.

One key challenge is data governance. Indonesia’s new “Undang-Undang Perlindungan Data Pribadi” (PDP Law), passed in 2022, establishes clear guidelines for personal data collection, usage, and storage. However, many AI developers still struggle to comply because their training data often includes public or scraped content without explicit consent. In 2024, several fintech startups faced scrutiny after users discovered that their loan scoring systems were accessing private contact lists and SMS histories without permission. Such practices highlight how AI ethics cannot be separated from privacy rights.

Another issue is bias and inclusivity. Global models often fail to capture local linguistic nuances or cultural diversity. For example, an AI trained predominantly on English data may misinterpret Bahasa Indonesia sentiment, leading to errors in moderation or customer service. Di beberapa kasus, sistem deteksi ujaran kebencian (hate speech) di media sosial menandai kata-kata dalam bahasa daerah sebagai “toxic” padahal sebenarnya netral. Ini contoh nyata bagaimana bias data bisa menimbulkan ketidakadilan digital.

To address this, local datasets and human annotation become critical. Universities and startups in Jakarta, Bandung, and Yogyakarta have begun collecting culturally relevant AI training data. Collaborative efforts between academia and government, like BRIN’s AI Ethics Taskforce, aim to set national standards for fair and responsible AI. These initiatives mirror global efforts such as the EU AI Act or OECD Principles on AI, but with a uniquely Indonesian flavor — emphasizing human dignity, equality, and social harmony.

Regulatory capacity is also a major bottleneck. Indonesia’s digital transformation is rapid, but institutional readiness to audit and enforce AI compliance is limited. Banyak pejabat publik yang belum memahami cara kerja AI secara mendalam, sehingga pengawasan cenderung reaktif. There is a growing need for “AI auditors” — professionals who combine knowledge of technology, ethics, and law. Systems like Aether could serve as tools to assist such audits, providing explainable and measurable accountability.

Another emerging topic is environmental ethics. AI training consumes enormous computational power, leading to significant carbon footprints. As Indonesia increases its data center investments, sustainability must become part of ethical AI discussions. Green AI — models optimized for energy efficiency — should be prioritized in government and corporate projects.

Finally, public education plays a vital role. Ethical AI isn’t just about compliance; it’s about literacy. Masyarakat perlu memahami kapan harus percaya pada AI dan kapan harus mempertanyakan hasilnya. This includes everything from deepfake awareness to understanding algorithmic decision-making in everyday applications.

In conclusion, Indonesia’s journey toward ethical AI is just beginning. Laws like the PDP Act provide a foundation, but true progress depends on collaboration among developers, regulators, and citizens. As AI becomes woven into daily life, its ethical success will depend not on technology alone, but on our collective willingness to question, audit, and guide it responsibly.
